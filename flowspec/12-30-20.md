## Notes

component cdf: each cdf means, remotelevel enclave can call this component, with
the following argtaints. argtaints breaks down intra vs inter domain flows
expected at the argument level

Constraint solving:

1: all variables are bound. check consistency.

2: remove all labels from flows, and have z3 assign labels to flows
(only one solution possible)

3: one of the components is not assigned a level (now there is more
than one possible solution)

4: a subset of the components and a subset of flow labels are bound

## Object model for Z3

```
Component
    id:        Int
    inflows:   [Flow]
    outflows:  [Flow]
    argtaints: [FlowLabel]
    lvl:       Enum(Orange | Green)

Flow:
    id:        Int
    msg:       String
    label:     FlowLabel

FlowLabel:
    id:        Int
    lvl:       Enum(Orange | Green)
    remote:    Enum(Orange | Green)
```
