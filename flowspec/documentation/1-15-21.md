## TODO list

high priority

1. dump smt string to file
2. check case1, case2, case3 for consistency
3. specify what constraints are checked, and the assumptions I make in "specification.tex"
4. z3 unsat-core explanations
5. prepared example: variants of case1, 2, 3 that are incorrect, with documentation of the error (e.g. case1 variant1 has known error ASDF)
6. variant of case1 with fields left out which HAS a solution, and variant of case1 with missing fields that DOES NOT have a solution

medium

1. optional command line argument for ruleset
2. implement ruleset constraints (rules are message allowed from color -> color)
3. correct rulesets for case1, case2, case3, and incorrect variants with error documentation
4. user-friendly explanations

lowest

1. implement consistency checking for argtaints (use current cdf format)
