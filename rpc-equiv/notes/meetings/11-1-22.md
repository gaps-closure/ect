## Meeting notes

- Functions can be called multiple times across the wire. This can give bogus? Important when defining correctness. Uniquely relevant in a network context.
- Rajesh wants us to define correctness. What does correctness mean in a networked context? It's the same as a local version of the call, SUBJECT to...
- Sometimes we WANT functions to be unreliable! E.g. gimme a video frame but if it gets lost whatever, I just ask for the next one. So in our specification, we have certain RPCs that are required, or not required. Part of the input.
- Stephen is saying perhaps we can just focus on 'fidelity to the original' and focus on the correctness of
the auto-generated code assuming a perfect network.
