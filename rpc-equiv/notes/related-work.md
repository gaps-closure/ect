Since this is interesting stuff, there is probably a lot of cutting edge work on it! We want the reading list to cover general semantic analysis of RPC code or concurrent code, general code analysis via SMT, and their intersection.

"The main challenge of this work is in generating an Isabelle/HOL proof script that corresponds to a generated implementation. Since the implementation is derived from a system architecture description, and the existing code generator is largely string- and template-based, it is infeasible to provide a single proof for the correctness of any possible glue code (that is, to verify the generator itself). Instead, we use a translation validation approach and build on our previous work that demonstrated the absence of undefined behaviour in component platform glue code"

## What's already been done?

- Automatic RPC stub generation verification via Isabelle/HOL for co-located components on SeL4.
- Deep verification using VST of a generic key-value server.

## What are the weaknesses / extension opportunities?

- Extend specific case to generated case
- Enforce strong memory isolation
- Extend to a network context
- Extend to platform independent C/LLVM
- Use Alive/SMT instead of Isabelle/HOL
