Since this is interesting stuff, there is probably a lot of cutting edge work on it! We want the reading list to cover general semantic analysis of RPC code or concurrent code, general code analysis via SMT, and their intersection.

## What's already been done?

- Automatic RPC stub generation verification via Isabelle/HOL for co-located components on SeL4.

## What are the weaknesses / extension opportunities?

- Enforce strong memory isolation
- Extend to a network context
- Extend to platform independent C/LLVM
- Use Alive/SMT instead of Isabelle/HOL
